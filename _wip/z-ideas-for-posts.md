## Data communism?

Was at a talk recently (17 Feb 2012) with Simon Hampton (google european policy director) and Mac of Horizon.

Simon mentioned the distinction between Content vs. Data.  I don't recall exactly but I think he also stated that data should be available regardless of the people who 'own' the content.  

Leads to interesting question.  I'm a bunch of data. My name, address, phone number, the sites I browse etc etc.  Where exactly is the line between what I do and what I am?  If we take Simon's point to an extreme, then I'm just a constant stream of data, which should be available without me having rights to it?  

not sure how most people feel about that, or even if they're thinking about it.  People often joke that if you're not paying for it then you are the product, but I don't many people thinke too deeply about what this means.  

Essentially, it feels like data-communism.  Nobody owns the 'data" it's free for anyone to do as they please with.  While I'm sure there are some amazing things that can be achieved if we pool all stuff together, we should not simply forgo the discussion of individual rights.
