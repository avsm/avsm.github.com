## Frictionless sharing could erode rights

As services become 'social' the ability to seamlessly share things with your colleagues and friends becomes widespread.  For example, Facebook allows users to connect their music services and share what their listening to with their friends.

In general, this type of sharing is considered largely innocuous, unless you count those occasions where your friends catch you listening to something embarrassing (though some services do offer a 'private listening' mode).  However, it seems that users who take advantage of this kind of frictionless sharing might inadvertently be eroding their rights.  At least in the USA.

An [article][law-review] in a student law review journal makes an intriguing point about this erosion in relation to social readers.  These are services that share your online reading habits with your social networks.  The [Fourth Amendment][] of the US Constitution guards against unreasonable searches and seizures which also relates to the "reasonable expectation of privacy".  It's this expectation of privacy where the issues seems to arise.

Specifically, in cases where the Fourth Amendment applies, the Supreme Court may need to decide what's reasonable and whether warrants are required before the government can collect information.  The fact that 'expectations' are involved necessarily means that cultural norms might play a role in such decisions.
