# Privacy, naming and Signposts

Post on why we need Signpost. Include info on the following:

- end-to-end connections and how the internet breaks them
- how signpost nams different things places
- why this matters and what it enables
- how it might change the way devices communicate and connect

comparison from DLD conference and Bill Gross quotes

Number of interenet enabled devices is proliferating

Signposts is timely in that allows all devices to connect to each other


There have been a number of fairly high profile conference recently where the internet and how it might look in the future was discussed.  One of the recurring themes seems related to the proliferation of mobile devices and the services that can be provided over them.  

Nikesh Arora of Google mentioned that "Consumers want a divergence of devices but a convergence of services".  It's safe to assume that Arora is hoping/expecting Google to provide the second half of his statement.  Assuming that there is actually divergence in mobile devices (iOS still leads by a wild margin), then the issue of connectivity becomes more and more important.  Arora, like many others has made one implicit assumption, which is that cloud services will provide the services and connectivity between devices.  This is a perfectly reasonable assumption since it's the way all current services have grown.  Essentially, a web-based service acts to host, co-ordinate and sync data from whichever devices are connected to it.  This system has worked well enough to date but there are certain caveats to solving the connectivity problem this way.

- Trust of 3rd party services
- Reduced control over data
- Proliferation of one-trick services

Indeed, you can imagine that Google stands to benefit a great deal if they can position themselves as the go-between for all your data online.  Provided a user opts into all their services, then they should reasonably expect to be able to co-ordinate/authenticate all their devices with one Google ID.  They'd get access to Picasa, Gmail, Latitude and host of other Google products all from frome ach of their devices.  You can see how this is quite a tempting offer, but it's also possible to imagine that all the services will be exactly what each user needs.
