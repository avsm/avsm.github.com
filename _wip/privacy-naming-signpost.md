# Connected devices, Web Services and Signpost

## Interest in connected devices

There have been a number of fairly high profile conferences recently where the internet, and how it might look in the future, were discussed.  One of the recurring themes is related to the proliferation of mobile devices and how to provide services over them.

The number of internet-enabled devices is increasing and mobile phones only represent one category.  Other types of devices could contain a multitude of sensors and be located almost anywhere.  For example, there are a couple of projects on Kickstarter that promise small sensor boxes which can be placed almost anywhere and use fora variety of purposes.  The fact that these devices have surpassed their funding goals so spectacularly (15x it's funding goals) indicates how excited people are about the possibilities of smart sensors and connected devices.  

Some obvious mechanisms might be a systems of cameras that form part of your home security system.  When your landlord's plumber rings your doorbell, the camera directs the sound/image to your phone so you can verify him.  Actuators may allow you to open the door and allow him access.  Cameras inside the flat could be useful in directing him to the stop-valve so he can get on with fixing the boiler while you're out at the shops (of course, you have to trust that he's not interested in your underwear).  

## Devices connected to ... proprietary web services?

Something that all the discussions have in common is how closely tied all these peripheral devices are to cloud-based services (phones included).  It's almost taken for granted that such devices need to 'dial home' in order to provide their services and allow users to configure them.  In all cases 'home' is likely proprietary software running outside the control of the end-user.  Something that isn't discussed as openly is the increasing amount of data that will have to pass through 3rd party services as a result.  At the moment it's almost unthinkable to talk about the 'internet-of-things' without also assuming that a 3rd party web service exists to administer and configure all the devices.  

Although many services will claim that security is paramount for them, it should be recognised that in many cases it's unlikely to be 'core-business'.  

I'd argue that this isn't really an internet of things as each set of devices will necessarily have it's own owners (the people who provide the concurrent services).  In fact, this is simply an extension of software into hardware, where the devices will only work 

What if the connectivity ins't a core part of their offering?  It's still possible to offer a secure model of conenctivety while focussing on the usability and enojoyment of the prodict.  Not everyone will become a security expert.

Post on why we need Signpost. Include info on the following:

- end-to-end connections and how the internet breaks them
- how signpost nams different things places
- why this matters and what it enables
- how it might change the way devices communicate and connect

Number of interenet enabled devices is proliferating

Signposts is timely in that allows all devices to connect to each other


There have been a number of fairly high profile conference recently where the internet and how it might look in the future was discussed.  One of the recurring themes seems related to the proliferation of mobile devices and the services that can be provided over them.  

Nikesh Arora of Google mentioned that "Consumers want a divergence of devices but a convergence of services".  It's safe to assume that Arora is hoping/expecting Google to provide the second half of his statement.  Assuming that there is actually divergence in mobile devices (iOS still leads by a wild margin), then the issue of connectivity becomes more and more important.  Arora, like many others has made one implicit assumption, which is that cloud services will provide the services and connectivity between devices.  This is a perfectly reasonable assumption since it's the way all current services have grown.  Essentially, a web-based service acts to host, co-ordinate and sync data from whichever devices are connected to it.  This system has worked well enough to date but there are certain caveats to solving the connectivity problem this way.

- Trust of 3rd party services
- Reduced control over data
- Proliferation of one-trick services

Indeed, you can imagine that Google stands to benefit a great deal if they can position themselves as the go-between for all your data online.  Provided a user opts into all their services, then they should reasonably expect to be able to co-ordinate/authenticate all their devices with one Google ID.  They'd get access to Picasa, Gmail, Latitude and host of other Google products all from frome ach of their devices.  You can see how this is quite a tempting offer, but it's also possible to imagine that all the services will be exactly what each user needs.  

The second issue that the aggregate data of all your Google usage, is owned by them.  This has benefits to the user, in that G can quickly offer new services and products, based on user behaviour, but it also means that your personal information is effectively owned by a corporation.  Of course, there are people who don't see this as a problem, and that's fine, but we should not allow ourselves to enter a world where there are effectively two tiers of online.  Those who are happy to share most details of their lives under any kind of ToS agreement and others who are inadvertendly forced off, simply because the are unwilling to give up so much access to their personal lives.  

The proliferation of apps that essentially aid connectivity are one of the reasons that we need a new system for connecting devices.

Another thing that most pundits predict is that all devices will essentially e able to get in


What users ultimately need is a method for connecting
