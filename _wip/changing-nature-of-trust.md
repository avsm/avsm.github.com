# Changing Nature of Trust


---

### notes

Blog on concept of trust.  I trust certain friends with money. Others with my life. these may not be the same people!  this is easy to understand. But what about trusting peopel with my private data? or my real-time location data? Or on facebook where every app *they* install can see *my* personal data?  Waht does this mean for our concepts of trust and responsibility?!  How do they have to evolve in order to enter the digital age.  Expecially when there there prospecters out there trying to data-mine the hell out of you.

Our concepts of trust are not evolving as fast as the technologies and software compaies can innovate,  This leads to an interesting connumdrum.  

Talk about data.  Data-communism.
