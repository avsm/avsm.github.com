# Signpost

The cloud is a (mostly) always available service that can be seen by
all devices. Without this, it is difficult for individual devices to
find each other.  **Signpost** is building "personal
cloud" infrastructure to let your devices all see each other without
requiring complex configuration

Peer-to-peer services are notoriously hard to use due to the
prevalence of firewalls and NAT middleboxes that prevent all of our
devices from seeing each other. Consider how difficult it is to obtain
a display from work into your home PC, or vice versa.  Many cloud
services have sprung up to assist with this, such as 
[GoToMyPC](http://gotomypc.com), but they all require you to give
access to your home infrastructure to an external third-party. Why is
it so difficult for our devices to be networked without these
services?

Signpost addresses the problem by probing connectivity and
using DNS updates to provide a constant "pointer" to your devices. In
addition, it also understands the *internal* structure of networks
(e.g. the home) and can directly redirect devices that are on the same
network to each other without going via the Internet. 

Stay tuned for an alpha release of this project around Easter 2012.
